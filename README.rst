Background 
----------

The use of crop models as part of scientific research models or economic farm tools leads to a 
wide  range  of  applications.  On  the  one  hand  they  need  to  be  simple;  on  the  other  hand  they  should  be  
complex  enough  to  simulate  a  variety  of  growth  mechanisms.  The  development  of  entirely  new  models  for  
different questions requires a lot of coding and work such as changes in the model structure, the inclusion of 
alternative  process  descriptions  or  the  implementation  of  additional  functionality.  Often,  added  model  
components do not really fit to the model philosophy of the originally developed base model. 

We  therefore  developed  a  flexible  (modular,  generic  and  mixed  procedural  object  oriented)  and  integrative  
(replaceable,  expandable,  independent  and  interactive)  software  tool  for  the  setup  of  adapted  crop  models.  
The Plant growth Modeling Framework (PMF) is based on the Unified Modeling Language and implemented in Python, a high level object-oriented programming language. PMF provides the code flexibility to rapidly 
exchange and compare different process mechanisms. An interface facilitates a straightforward coupling with 
other models.
